 Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example (also known as an SSCCE).
Mutable states problems
    Error prone
    hard to reason
    hard to make concurrent
Higher Order Function means
we can pass Function to Function
we can create Function within Function
we can return Function from Function

Functions have to be pure, they don't have side effects
1. does not change anything
2. does not depend of anything that changes

Imperative vs Declarative
how             what
Mutate          transform
side-effects    pure
pass objects    pass Function also
hard to compose Functional composition

java -p => module path
java -f output/second.jar -d => will tell you the name

Everything in the class path goes for Unnamed module
Automatic module is old jar coming to life in module path
Explicitly named module are new stuff in the module path.- has module descriptor
